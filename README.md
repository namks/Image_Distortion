# Image Distortion

This repository aims to produce the various distorted version of the original images.
The term "Distortion" contains the followings:
  * Rotation
  * Translation
  * Zoom-in or Zoom-out
  * Change in resolution
  * Adding noise
  
This code uses PIL library of Python, so you should install PIL before running this code.

```
pip install image
```

## Rotation

You can specify the angle to rotate as an argument.

## Translation

You can specify the number of pixels to translate in both x-axis and y-axis as arguments.

## Zoom-in and Zoom-out

You can specify the proportion of zoom as an argument.

## Change resolution

You can specify the proportion of resizing as an argument.

## Adding noise

You can specify the extent of noise as an argument.
This code gives the Gaussian noise to the image.
